Thoughts on the system architecture:
  Stack:
    React
    Node / Express: fast, nonblocking I/O; we don't have a need
      for intensive computation on the server side
    Mocha
    Chai
    Enzyme: for testing in a React / ES6 environment
    Airbnb style guide
    HTTPS for location-based services in Chrome per https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/geolocation-on-secure-contexts-only?hl=en
    NPR One API: http://dev.npr.org/
    HTML5 Geolocation API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation

Follow up on / next steps:
  - get SSL certs working
  - set up React imports to get client side rendering
  - verify that gulp-env is working
  - followup on radio API and determine what data is available
  - wireframes for frontend
  - DB choice and schema design


Reminders
  - SSL certs are sort of working for development only - need to find a way to enable https in Chrome with 
  self-signed certificates
  - the commented out code in server.js is an alternate approach to SSL certs that will need to be tested once
  site is in production
